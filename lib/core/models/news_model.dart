    title: 'NWSL looks to capitalize on Team USA\'s Olympic success',
    content:
        'The National Women\'s Soccer League has traditionally experienced increased interest following a successful U.S. run in a major international tournament.\n\nNWSL teams are poised to capitalize again as the regular season resumes this weekend in the wake of the reinvigorated U.S. team\'s gold medal run at the Paris Olympics.\n\n"These international tournaments give us an opportunity to measure our league on a world stage and see how our players are performing. And we couldn\'t have been prouder of the NWSL representation at the Olympics," commissioner Jessica Berman said. "Just being able to have representation across the world really affirms for us that our strategy about how we\'re going to attract more international talent is working."\n\nThe league hasn\'t had an opportunity for a post-championship bump in years as the United States hadn\'t claimed a title since the 2019 Women\'s World Cup. But the Americans went undefeated in France en route to a 1-0 victory over Brazil in the final for the team\'s first gold since 2012.\n\nThe match drew an average of 9 million viewers on NBC and Peacock, more than any women\'s final since the 2004 Athens Games. The slogan "Gold Plays Here" was splashed across a full-page ad in the New York Times with a celebratory photo of U.S. forwards Trinity Rodman, Mallory Swanson and Sophia Smith — all NWSL players.\n\nThis is the environment as the NWSL returns from a month-long break for the Olympics.\n\nOne of the biggest attendance bumps in the league\'s history came after the U.S. team\'s 2019 World Cup win. That year, attendance rose nearly 22% before dipping the next year due to COVID. Viewership for the NWSL championship game on ESPN jumped by 43% that year.\n\nFive years later, the league is in a better position to take advantage of the moment, Berman told The Associated Press.\n\n"For the first time, we have an infrastructure in the league that is prepared to launch a strategy that is coming out of the Olympics. So at the league level, we are coordinating across all of our clubs for back-to-market dates and making sure that the fans have an opportunity to celebrate the players who are returning back to the NWSL," she said.\n\nThe NWSL had 56 players — more than any other women\'s professional league globally — scattered among 11 of the 12 teams that played in France. Nineteen of the 22 U.S. Olympians play in the domestic league.',

        'Branded stadiums turn community hubs into billboards. Memories are still made, but the corporate influence dulls the purity of the experience\n\nThe Cleveland Browns held an oddly celebratory press conference last week to announce the sale of the naming rights to their stadium to Huntington Bank, a regional bank headquartered in Columbus, Ohio. For the next 20 years, what was once Cleveland Browns Stadium will be known as Huntington Bank Field. Never mind that Huntington Bank Field is a laughably generic name that does not even attempt to maintain continuity with the arena’s two most recent monikers, both of which labeled it a stadium rather than a field; the real catch is that the Browns haven’t even decided whether to renovate their current home on the shore of Lake Erie or build a new stadium in Cleveland’s southwestern suburbs.\n\nUnder the terms of the deal, the Browns’ home will be Huntington Bank Field wherever it ends up: the stadium now has a fixed name but a curious air of ephemerality hangs over its address.\n\nThe prospect of this proud old franchise beginning the new NFL season in a stadium with a name but no certain place offers a striking illustration of the power of money to rip modern sport from its roots, to detach it from history, community, a sense of belonging. Corporate sponsorship has become such an indispensable force in sport that it’s now more powerful and perhaps, in some ways, even more real than the very things – clubs, shirts, buildings – it sponsors.\n\nMore than it is a collection of players, coaches, and fans, the modern professional club is a series of marketing deals. Selling stadium naming rights is now a major priority for clubs across the US and Europe, though the sums involved are hardly enormous. The Browns didn’t disclose the terms of their deal with Huntington Bank but their last sale of naming rights, to FirstEnergy from 2013-2023, brought in a relatively piddling \$6m a year. Manchester City’s sale of its home ground’s naming rights to Etihad reportedly gives the club £21.9m a season, which is barely enough to buy half an English fullback on the transfer market. Still, these deals represent money through the door, and in an era of increasingly “sophisticated” investment capital in professional sport and booming viewerships, the one thing clubs must do in order to survive and thrive is generate revenue, wherever and whenever it is available.\n\nIn the Premier League, virtually every club is now looking to copy early movers like Arsenal, Leicester City and Manchester City and flog off the naming rights to their stadium. Those clubs, of course, inked their naming deals this century as part of the move into new stadiums; the ickiness of the brand associations was lessened somewhat by the newness of the structures to which the sponsors’ names were attached. Now, however, storied old grounds like Old Trafford and Anfield look to be up for appellative auction, following the example of cash-strapped Barcelona, which in 2022 sacrificed more than a century of high-minded tradition – “Més que un club” and all that – in the name of debt service and rebranded its historic stadium as the “Spotify Camp Nou.”\n\nOnce bulwarks against social and economic flux, totems of tradition and custom, these historic structures are falling under the regime of impermanence that governs everything else in 21st century life. To see their clubs sell out for such puny returns and wimp into branded everything will rightly leave many fans livid.',

    title: 'Chelsea in talks over building new stadium at Earl’s Court',
    content:
        'Chelsea have held talks over ­leaving Stamford Bridge and moving to Earl’s Court as they seek a resolution to their plans for a bigger stadium. Increasing the capacity from 40,343 is a major priority for the owners and the diffi­culty of redeveloping the ground has led the club to look for a new site in west London.\n\nDiscussions have been held with Transport for London, one of the partners that looks after the Earl’s Court site, and the real estate ­developer Delancey. The Earl’s Court Development Committee wants to build a mixed-use development and no football stadium is included in its master plan, which is due to be ­presented next week to ­Hammersmith and Fulham council and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea council.\n\nThe ECDC will be able to move ahead if it receives planning permis­sion and that would place a major obstacle in Chelsea’s way. Key ­figures involved in ­planning in ­London believe the plans could be too expensive and that could open the door for Chelsea because a ­multiuse football stadium would in those ­circumstances be ­attractive. There would be the potential to build ­affordable housing on the site if ­Chelsea’s plan is approved.\n\nChelsea are understood to have drawn up plans and to have ­identified the Lillie Bridge depot as the area on which to build. Jason Gannon, the Chelsea chief executive, has been leading discussions and had productive talks with TfL and Delancey. The club would need an agreement with Chelsea Pitch Owners, which holds the freehold of Stamford Bridge stadium and could block any attempt to move.\n\nChelsea have not ruled out staying put but there has been no progress in any plans to redevelop Stamford Bridge. The ground’s proximity to a tube line makes a rebuild extremely challenging. Chelsea have considered a stand-by-stand rebuild and they could be forced to play at a ­temporary home, likely Wembley, for a number of years if they knock down ­Stamford Bridge. Chelsea made space for such a project after completing the purchase of a 1.2-acre site next to Stamford Bridge from Stoll, a housing charity for veterans.\n\nChelsea would need to submit a bid for Earl’s Court, with a source saying a conservative estimate of its value could be about £500m. The club’s owners are committed to maximising revenues by building one of the biggest and best stadiums in the country.\n\nA potential obstacle for ­Chelsea is the civil war between their ­co-owners. Clearlake Capital, the majority shareholder, and Todd ­Boehly have fallen out and are ­looking at ways to buy each other out.\n\nA spokesperson for the ECDC said: “There is no plan within our plans for Chelsea FC to relocate to the Earl’s Court site. We have a fully detailed design, shortly to be registered with both local authorities, which prioritises the delivery of thousands of homes and jobs, culture and open space through a well-designed and considered master plan which has evolved over four years of engagement. This will see development commence in 2026 with the first residents and occupiers moving in from 2030. This is, and will remain, our primary focus.”\n\nChelsea have been approached for comment.',

        'The Premier League’s era of vanity worship may be over but the future won’t be equal',
    content:
        'The league has bared its teeth on teams in breach of profitability and sustainability rules. But the current enforcement has solidified the disparity between clubs\n\nThis Premier League season will be remembered for many things: as the season when the Kop lost its Klopp, as the season of “Well done boys, good process”, as a time in which the “agent of chaos”, whether named Darwin or Jérémy or Kaoru or Kai, offered a brief and sparkling reprieve from the monotonous precision of the relentlessly rehearsed modern game. Mostly, though, it will be remembered as the season of teeth.\n\nBy near-universal consensus, the points deductions imposed on Everton and Nottingham Forest, as well as the ongoing investigation into Leicester City’s finances (not to mention the 115 charges still pending against Manchester City), prove at long last that the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules “have teeth” – or “unexpected teeth”, as one commentator put it. The Super League fiasco and the ongoing failure of the Premier League to secure an equitable deal for the distribution of media revenue down the football pyramid, meanwhile, have highlighted the need for a “regulator that has real teeth” – a need that the recently introduced football governance bill, many believe, may help address. The age of the soccer regulators is upon us, and suddenly their fangs are everywhere. Not since the days when Luis Suárez was feasting on the arms and shoulders of his opponents has there been quite so much attention paid in English football to matters of dentition.\n\nThere’s no question that we are traveling into an era of much more muscular governance of soccer, in England and across Europe. Rules that have existed in writing for years are now suddenly being enforced with surprising ferocity. Any measure to curb the financial excesses of the past two decades, even the playing field between English football’s giants and minnows, and put the sport on a more sustainable economic footing is surely a good thing – but how sharp are the new adjudicatory chompers bearing down on the English game, really? And what does this sudden flurry of regulatory activity mean for the owners of clubs like Chelsea, whose expectations of easy revenue generation now find themselves suddenly disturbed?\n\nThere’s a generous reading to all of this, which presents the recent regulatory outburst as proof of a sincere effort on the part of the Premier League to get its house in order and put top-flight football on a path to more equitable growth, and a cynical one, which holds that regulation is a useful facade to conceal and legitimize deeper inequalities within the game. With apologies to all the footballing nostalgics out there, who imagine that the Premier League is going to drop an adverse ruling against Manchester City on the penultimate day of the season and send the reigning champions packing to League Two, I tend towards the latter perspective.\n\nThe Premier League’s flurry of rulings and investigations into clubs that have fallen foul of its profitability rules only makes sense when viewed in the context of the UK government’s determination to create an independent football regulator. Both parties, the Premier League and the government, are now engaged in a form of regulatory competition to win the argument over who is best placed to steward the sport. Everything about the Premier League’s handling of the investigations to date – the strength of the sanctions, the ostentatious commitment to due process, the careful reasoning in the written rulings, the independence and impartiality of the commissions it’s empaneled to hear the cases – has been designed as a demonstration to the world that the Premier League is quite capable of regulating itself without the need for a pesky, state-created ombudsman to get involved. After the introduction of the football governance bill last month, the Premier League issued a comically tepid statement in which it pledged to “study” the bill while registering its “concern” about “any unintended consequences of legislation that could weaken the competitiveness and appeal of English football”.\n\nThe most important of the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability rules is the one that’s unwritten: enforcement cannot become so aggressive as to dull the global appeal of the league.\n\nWhenever a principal empowers an agent and the agent begins to act against the interests of the principal, the problem of “agency costs” arises. The real test of how pointy the Premier League’s new machinery of self-regulation is will come when the commissions investigating financial breaches begin to act in a way that cuts into the interests of the league’s biggest clubs. Tellingly, it’s teams in the bottom half of the table – those on the way to almost-certain relegation or even, in Leicester’s case, already relegated – that have been punished first. Until we see one of the Big Six or Seven (or whatever we’re calling them now) take a hit, the agency costs of the Premier League’s new era of accountability will remain invitingly low for the clubs at the top.\n\nThere’s an existential issue at stake here: how far can independent commissions and regulators go, how effective and uncaptured can they really be, in a world where it’s still the clubs themselves that decide the rules and the distribution of revenue? The bigger clubs have outsized influence thanks to their history, financial heft, and global popularity. Until there’s blood on the floor from a Manchester City or a Chelsea or a Newcastle (just to take three random examples), the Premier League’s profitability and sustainability regime will always appear, to jaded eyes at least, like a feudal system of entrenched privilege that punishes the serfs while letting the lords off scot-free.\n\nAlready one can picture the lawyers at the top clubs probing the emerging jurisprudence on the profitability rules for signs of weakness, potential loopholes. Spending “in the general interests of football” does not count towards the assessment of profitability, which has generally been taken to mean that money can be allocated to club infrastructure, women’s teams, and youth academies without limit or sanction. This exemption – who knows? – could eventually become a useful sink in which to launder spending on player wages and transfers; it’s not hard to imagine a near future in which the finest academy facilities on the planet miraculously spring from the soil of England’s top clubs, and a cheese cave blooms in every stand throughout the land.\n\nThe big clubs might not even have to probe that far to find ways around the existing regulations, since those regulations are probably not long for this world. Lost in all the enthusiasm about the rise of the regulators has been an acknowledgment that the Premier League itself, as it announced a few weeks ago, is gearing up to completely revamp its architecture of financial governance. Regulation with teeth? Given their impending demise, the profitability and sustainability rules are a set of dentures at best. Most reports suggest that the Premier League will shift the focus of its financial controls from profitability to something closer to the “squad cost” ratio that Uefa has introduced. Instead of stipulating a hard currency limit to the annual losses a club can incur, as under the current profitability rules, this would involve limiting a club’s spending on wages and transfer fees to a set percentage of its revenue.\n\nWhatever form it ultimately settles into, whether it targets profitability or squad cost, this new regulatory architecture almost certainly signals the end of the Premier League’s era of vanity ownership, under which Abramovich-style splashing of the cash, without regard for losses, became a viable pathway to generate on-field success. This is, naturally, a good thing, but it doesn’t necessarily portend a more equal world. A squad cost rule will effectively function as a kind of salary cap, but in only the softest sense, and with none of the additional balancing mechanisms (drafts, equal distribution of TV income) that make the capped and cartel-like leagues of the major US sports so consistently even. Without redistributive US-style controls to level the overall playing field, a squad cost rule will inevitably benefit bigger clubs, whose revenues dwarf those of the clubs below: Manchester City reported revenue of £712.8m last season, almost three times the £250m in income that Newcastle United – not exactly a club without means – recorded. Needless to say, surviving on 75%, say, of £712m represents a very different proposition to life under a fiscal ceiling that taps out at 75% of £250m.',

        'A US Premier League game would be wildly popular – and demean everyone',
    content:
        'The dream – or nightmare – of a 39th Premier League match in America has drawn a little closer. After reaching a settlement with US promoter Relevent Sports, Fifa last week signaled it will consider changes to its policy of blocking league matches from being played outside the league’s home country. The indication that Fifa’s thinking on the issue may be evolving in a more flexible direction will be welcomed by Europe’s top clubs and deplored by football traditionalists.\n\nFor clubs, the commercial case is clear. This is an argument anchored not in culture but money. The work of evangelizing soccer is already done; the sport is not like American football, say, or rugby league, or basketball, or even cricket, which are still trawling the globe for converts and regularly hold matches overseas. In the world of professional sport, football is No 1 and probably always will be. Taking chunks of the European domestic season on the road represents a juicy financial opportunity, potentially unlocking valuable revenue to help weather the storm of a newly restrictive regulatory environment and bringing teams closer to the millions of football fans who live outside Europe.\n\nCup competitions are already being staged away from home – the Italian and Spanish football federations, for instance, have sold the hosting rights to their second-tier cups to Saudi Arabia – and top clubs regularly tour the Americas and Asia in preseason. Theoretically it’s only a small step from that to transplanting league matches abroad – Barcelona attempted to host a La Liga mach against Girona in Miami in 2018, which led to the Relevent lawsuit. These could take place anywhere, but the Gulf and the US seem the most likely destinations.\n\nStaging a 39th match in America has long been a fever dream of the Premier League. The idea was floated and abandoned in the 2000s, generating backlash so fierce the project now has its own Wikipedia page. More recently New Jersey governor Phil Murphy has suggested his state – now confirmed as the venue for the 2026 World Cup final – as the ideal stage for an overseas extension of the English top-flight season. As anyone who saw the hordes of Premheads pleading for a word of acknowledgment from [checks notes] Joleon Lescott in the background of NBC’s recent Premier League fan fest in Nashville can attest, even crumbs of contact with the flesh and blood of European club football are enough to send the average US football fan into paroxysms of delight. Just imagine the scenes once these fans are given the chance to watch Nicolas Jackson and Noni Madueke bicker over the penalty spot in a proper, points-on-the-table league match. Riots, mass fainting, Cole Palmer stepping up to convert the penalty instead: anything is possible.\n\nOnce the north London derby is successfully grafted on to north New Jersey, who can say where the quest for cash may take professional football? Compared to US pro sports, which have mastered the art of turning every moment of the sporting season into a revenue-generating spectacle, Europe’s grand old clubs are relatively inexpert at extracting value from events off the field. Once all those competition draws and transfer windows and points deductions are converted into monetizable units for the overseas fanbase, we could be just a few years away from the Premier League’s independent commissions handing down their financial rulings from Madison Square Garden, “Mandalay Bay Resort & Casino presents the Progressive Insurance Winter Transfer Deadline Day!”, or a special PGMOL meet and greet on the Jeddah Corniche (tickets required, respect for VAR optional).\n\nTraditionalists will be aghast at these suggestions, and rightly so. Football, perhaps more than any other sport, has a potent sense of place, from which its traditions and rituals are inseparable. Manchester United v Liverpool at Philadelphia’s Lincoln Financial Field might be good business, but it’s no longer really the same game; it’s football, but defanged and kitschified, drained of the genuine stakes that remain vital to the sport’s enduring cultural power. It’s football, but not really from England any more; it’s the Global English Premier League, a fungible asset and floating signifier that can be pulled from its home soil and plugged into any climate for any purpose at any time. It’s sport, in other words, from nowhere.\n\nThis is the story that’s usually told in opposition to “Game 39” and similar schemes for sending domestic leagues off on a week abroad – that the dismemberment of these competitions into standalone export-grade packages violates heritage and disrespects the home fanbase. But plonking a matchday down in suburban Texas or Miami would also, I believe, do a disservice to football fans overseas.\n\nThese events would, it’s important to stress, be idiotically popular. After years of subsisting on the weak sauce of pre-season tours and B-list exhibition matches, most fans outside Europe would be naturally overjoyed at the chance to watch a legitimate league match live. But obliterating the distance that separates the “foreign” fan from the real thing – the live match, the stadium experience, the massed ranks cooing in the stands – would also, I think, destroy the romance of watching football overseas. The beauty of enjoying these matches from afar is precisely in the distance that the spectator holds from the action – in the notion of Europe and European football that non-European fans build for themselves. Fan culture in the world beyond a club’s traditional turf has a texture all to itself, and is no less beautiful or valid for its mutation from the norms established at home base.\n\nIf I’m not watching at home, I watch most of my live European club football at a bar in Brooklyn. The group identities of the fans who gather there bear some resemblance to those of their autochthonous counterparts, but there are important divergences too; a Manchester United fan in the outer boroughs of New York is never exactly the same as a Manchester United fan in Manchester (or – honk – London, for that matter). Each of the fan groups at my Brooklyn bar has its own weird charisma. The Chelsea fans: a mix of high school history teachers, drug dealers, and statistical bores who are frighteningly available for any match on the calendar. The Spurs fans: part-time DJs and wannabe edgelords with strong opinions about breakfast tacos. The Arsenal fans are usually too tired to make it out to watch their team; on the rare occasion, you’ll see one or two slumped at the bar, grousing about the lack of minutes for Emile Smith Rowe, raising a dadly, seen-it-all-before “Arsenal, Arsenal” whenever Martin Ødegaard makes a dart inside. The single known Manchester City fan has a habit of screaming “ROBOT” whenever Erling Haaland scores. Whether it’s in New York or Nebraska or Kentucky or Kuala Lumpur, overseas fan culture is just as sensitive to the vagaries of place as fan culture in the “sending” city is.\n\nThe moment the Premier League becomes a live American entertainment on par with any other, it will inevitably lose some of its faraway luster – it’ll be just another roll at the buffet. And the fans who tune in to English matches every week on American TV will also shed some of their oddball charm.',

        'Aston Villa fans’ lame resistance to ticket price greed lets hierarchy off the hook',
    content:
        'Unaware of the power they wield, football supporters remain reluctant to stage visible acts of dissent against clubs that routinely exploit them\n\nIf the powers that be at Aston Villa were remotely concerned their decision to charge extortionately high prices for tickets to Champions League home games this season might lead to repercussions in the form of any sort of meaningful fan protest, they were sent a very clear message on Saturday night. The pointed refusal by the Villa Park crowd to get behind a very minor, but arguably important, act of dissent planned by one supporters’ group let them know in no uncertain terms that the denizens of Villa Park have reached peak meek subservience.\n\nTheir unwillingness even to rock the boat gently in the face of grotesque exploitation at the hands of their club let the hierarchy know they could almost certainly have gone full Oasis, sanctioned dynamic pricing and got away with charging them an awful lot more for tickets. It should be added that the relationship between Villa and their fanbase is far from unique in this regard, but as the club prepare to pull up a chair to Europe’s top table for the first time in 41 years when they take on Young Boys in Berne on Tuesday night, it happens to be the one making headlines.\n\nAs reported on Saturday by the Guardian, a crowdfunder set up by the fans’ group Villa Academy in the buildup to their Premier League match against Everton paid for 16,000 red cards which matchgoers were encouraged to wave in the direction of the directors’ box for the first 97 seconds after kick-off. The timeframe was significant – a second for each pound the most expensive tickets will cost for Villa’s home group matches against Bayern Munich, Bologna, Juventus and Celtic. As the home side got the ball rolling at 5.30pm there was little or no sign of fan insurrection and the only cards brandished during Villa’s impressive come‑from‑behind win against Sean Dyche’s hapless side were produced from the pocket of Craig Pawson, the referee.\n\nVilla’s blase revelation of how much it would cost to attend Champions League group matches at Villa Park has been viewed by more than 6.4 million people on X and reaction was almost universally negative. The usual incredulous epithets – “disgrace”, “outrageous”, “the game’s gone” – were bandied about, with the prices being compared unfavourably with those charged by Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal for the same competition.\n\nEven Newcastle, unused to PR wins since being taken over by the Saudi Public Investment Fund in 2021, emerged with credit when it was revealed the highest price for any of their three Champions League home games last season was a full £15 less than the cheapest ticket available for any of Villa’s four. Many longstanding Villa season‑ticket holders are said to have been priced out of seeing their team play at the very highest level, and those who can afford to pay are dutifully coughing up because … well, of course they are and why wouldn’t they?\n\nThe Football Supporters’ Association accused Villa of “exploiting the loyalty of fans” and the Aston Villa Supporters’ Trust described the club hierarchy as “out of touch”. With monotonous predictability, club officials proved exactly how in touch they are by following the lead of other top-flight clubs and blaming the decision to rinse supporters on the Premier League’s pesky profitability and sustainability rules. Increasingly a convenient but completely disingenuous excuse behind which greedy club officials have found a relatively safe place to hide, they are increasingly cited as a “nothing to do with us, guv” justification to jack up the prices of everything from season tickets to match-day parking spaces and half-time pies. Astonishingly, large swathes of assorted fanbases seem to lap up this drivel.\n\nLet’s do some rough sums. A reduction in price of £20 for each ticket for the Villa matches in question would cost the club just over 20% of the £15.6m they receive from Uefa for qualifying for the Champions League. Factoring in prize money, just two group‑stage wins would more than cover such a reduction, a salient point that might well have been raised with Chris Heck at the meeting he was invited to attend with the fan advisory board in May regarding ticket prices, if only Villa’s president of business operations had deigned to turn up. Villa argued that the chief operating officer, Ben Hatton, who was among three club representatives to attend, was the most suitable person to have been there.\n\nWhen Villa Academy announced on social media last week that its whip-round had been a success, the red cards had been ordered and its protest at the beginning of the Everton match was ready to go ahead, the post was not so much greeted with apathy as outright hostility by fellow fans. It seemed that in an apparent volte‑face from the previous week, they had decided any visible act of dissent in the stands might undermine the efforts of Unai Emery and his team.\n\nGiven the feelgood factor in which Villa Park has been enveloped since the Spaniard took charge of a team 17th in the Premier League and steered them into Europe’s elite, it is no great surprise that supporters are reluctant to dampen the mood, even if their team’s rude health is being routinely exploited by executives at a club that steadfastly refuses to care about its fans anywhere near as much as they care about it.\n\nWith a few notable exceptions – the mooted Super League breakaway, a planned Liverpool ticket price hike and the lockdown furlough scheme – the protests of Premier League fanbases against club owners have traditionally been lame, unsuccessful and largely restricted to blink-and-miss-it token acts of defiances. Unaware of the power they wield, supporters remain reluctant to take any kind of stand that might give the subjects of their ire food for thought in case it adversely affects their match-day fun or the efforts of their team. However, if we have reached a point where even an act of fan insubordination so minor as to be negligible is discouraged because Bayern Munich are coming back to town, then the money-grubbing gougers really have prevailed.',

    title: 'Brest take first steps into European football against all the odds',
    content:
        'Seventy-four years into their existence, having been founded in 1950, the chance for Stade Brestois to finally make their European debut has been long-awaited. Not only will Wednesday’s match mark the Champions League debut but the clash with Sturm Graz is Les Ti’Zefs’ maiden match in European football.\n\nOnly promoted back from France’s second division in 2019, Brest have operated on the fringes of Ligue 1 since then, with a mid-table finish (11th in 2021-22) their best placement before last season. However, under the incredible (and unlikely, given his record) stewardship of Éric Roy, the team finished third in the final standings, edging out Lille, Nice and Lyon, and also playing cohesive, modern attacking football.\n\nThey have earned their reward, playing in the continent’s biggest competition, but will do so with a roster depleted by the summer transfer window. While several of the stars of last season’s team, including the playmaker Romain Del Castillo and the influential central midfielder Pierre Lees-Melou, have resisted overtures towards their departure, others have not.\n\nGone are the promising young centre-back Lilian Brassier, departed for Marseille on a loan with purchase option and the striker Steve Mounié – a face perhaps familiar to English fans for an ill-fated stint at Huddersfield during the club’s brief spell in the Premier League. The team have also lost a pair of players who were not regular starters but nevertheless vital cogs in Roy’s approach, the versatile and hard-working forwards Martín Satriano and Jérémy Le Douaron.\n\nThere has been some movement to replace that quartet, but a trolley-dash spending spree in the final days of the transfer market yielded only Mama Baldé, a fleetingly effective presence during his time at Troyes but underwhelming at Lyon; Romain Faivre, who returns to the club where he made his name after an itinerant and wholly mediocre two years; Ludovic Ajorque, who impressed at Strasbourg but was poor in Germany; and the young Malian international Kamory Doumbia, who was with the club on loan last season, but often struggled to get into the team.\n\nDespite the allure of Champions League football, the team found recruitment to be difficult, a fact underscored by the quality of their arrivals, but also the destinations of their departed players. Le Douaron went to Palermo, a historic club in Italy but one playing in the second division, while Mounié joined Augsburg in Germany on a free. Even Brassier, despite Marseille’s impressive project, and a probable wage increase, has joined a team where he might not be a guaranteed starter, and one not even competing in Europe, let alone the Champions League.\n\nHowever, when one looks at the draw, aside from a home match against Bayer Leverkusen and a pair of matches against Real Madrid and Barcelona, the Bretons seem to have presented with a rather favourable set of fixtures. After facing Sturm Graz this week, their other four matches are against RB Salzburg, Sparta Prague, Shakhtar Donetsk and PSV Eindhoven. To say that Les Pirates would be outright favourites in any of those would belie their summer of turmoil, but they would not rank as outsiders against any of that quintet. The supposed level of eight to 10 points needed to reach the play-0ff round seems well within their reach.\n\nBrest have been traditionally strong at home. The Stade Francis-Le Blé was a fortress last season as the team lost just twice. But, Uefa has insisted that the team will play in EA Guingamp’s Stade de Roudourou , located over 100km away from their own stadium.\n\nGuingamp have played in Europe in the last decade and the stadium was renovated in 2018, but at more than an hour from Brest by car, the trip has the potential to severely limit any home advantage the neophytes may have hoped to enjoy. However, Brest will have the advantage of facing an Austrian side who have not played since the international break, owing to flooding in that country, something which may give them enough of an edge.\n\nBrest have been inconsistent at the start of this season. After a 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Marseille to open the season, the team looked sharper but still lost to 10-man Lens the next weekend before beating Saint-Étienne. On Saturday, against a weakened Paris Saint-Germain XI, Brest lost 3-1 in the capital.\n\nTo date, only bottom-placed Montpellier have conceded more than Brest in the Ligue 1, and the team will be without Lees-Melou, the left back Bradley Locko and Faivre against Sturm Graz.\n\nRoy has claimed that the Champions League experience should be savoured, first and foremost. “After having achieved what we did last year, if we don’t start from the principle of enjoying it and experiencing it to the fullest, it’s a bit stupid,” he said.\n\nThis sentiment was also echoed by Brendan Chardonnet, a product of the club’s academy and a native of Saint-Renan, a tiny fishing town at the far end of Brittany. The defender spoke not about any trepidation, but about a sense of regional pride being of primal importance, as well as the prospect of being competitive in the face of the aforementioned kind draw. “The fact that we’re underdogs doesn’t mean that we’re not professionals and competitive. Getting here means that we proved we have quality, and we’re going to prove that again.\n\n“It’s important that the players learn about the region and the city and what the fans expect from them. I try to show them around the area, if they’re looking for a restaurant or a nice place to visit. Being from Brittany is about being proud of your region. We like to show that, and you’ll see Breton flags at events wherever you go here.”\n\nIf that combination of regional pride and enjoying the moment is to have any hope of continuing in the competition past January, a win over Sturm Graz is all but imperative for Brest, even if it is not (exactly) on home soil.',

  //       'Everything you need to know about Manchester City’s hearing and charges',
  //   content:
  //       'As an independent commission prepares to assess the charges levelled at the club, here’s what it all means\n\nWhat are the accusations against Manchester City?\n\nThe Premier League has charged the champions with more than 100 breaches of competition rules between the seasons 2009-10 and 2022-23. The charges cover four areas: a failure to give “a true and fair view of the club’s financial position”; a failure to “include full details” of player and manager remuneration; breaches of national and continental financial fair play regulations; and a failure to “cooperate with, and assist, the Premier League in its investigations”. The counts will be heard by a three-person independent commission, starting on Monday, in what is thought to be a London location.\n\nDo we have specifics?\n\nThe Premier League has published only an extended charge sheet, with no details. The timeframes, however, suggest the charges line up with claims already in the public domain. First, that City inflated the value of sponsorship deals as a means of channelling more money from their owners into the club. Second, that secret payments were made to the manager Roberto Mancini and to the then agent of Yaya Touré. Third, that these acts left the club contravening financial rules. Fourth, that when the Premier League sought to investigate the claims, City obstructed it. City have always denied any wrongdoing.\n\nWhy do the charges matter?\n\nBecause of their seismic nature and implications, whatever the verdict. Because they are unprecedented in the domestic game. And because of City’s dominance. In the 14 seasons covered by the charges, City won seven Premier League titles, six League Cups, three FA Cups and the Champions League. Since then they have won another Premier League, the Uefa Super Cup and the Fifa Club World Cup. They have played in the Champions League every season from 2011-12. This has driven the global pre‑eminence of the Premier League and increasing transfer fees (City’s squad is worth £1bn-plus). There are arguments, too, that it has affected competitive balance here and across Europe, led to the near-development of a breakaway Super League (of which City were a part) and quickened the need for independent regulation of English football. In February 2023 when the charges were brought the La Liga president, Javier Tebas, called the English top flight a “doped market”. On Friday, he told Mundo Deportivo: “I have spoken with many Premier League clubs and most of them understand that City should be sanctioned.” If City are judged to have found success while breaking the rules, the game will come under greater scrutiny.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nUnder Premier League instruction, Murray Rosen KC has selected three people to form the independent commission that will hear the charges, with one member of this panel required to be a financial expert. The hearings will be conducted privately and, though there is no formal timeframe, legal experts believe it will take a minimum of two months. When the commission publishes its verdict, either side can go to an appeals panel and, after this, arbitration. If all fails, either could attempt to find an argument to take to the high court. Under the rules of association of the Premier League there is no opportunity for either party to go to the court of arbitration for sport (Cas) in Switzerland.\n\nIf guilty, what could the punishment be?\n\nAccording to rule W.51 in the Premier League handbook, a commission has the ability to levy a wide range of sanctions against any club found to have broken the rules. These include fines, the docking of points and suspension, or even expulsion, from the competition. In fact, subclause W.51.7 states that the commission can “impose upon the respondent any combination of the foregoing or such other penalty as it shall think fit”. That even leaves open the possibility of City being stripped of their titles.\n\nWhat do City say?\n\nThe champions are bullish. On the record the club says it “welcomes the review” and the opportunity to “impartially consider the comprehensive body of irrefutable evidence that exists in support of its position”. Club sources also say City were not informed of the charges before they were published online. Finally, they argue that the club has been under investigation for breaching financial rules before, and were cleared.\n\nHaven’t we been here with Uefa?\n\nIn 2020 Uefa suspended City from the Champions League for two years for “overstating its sponsorship revenue in its accounts” between 2012 and 2016, part of the same period covered by the Premier League’s charges. However, that sanction was overturned on appeal by Cas. In its ruling Cas found that a number of the claims brought by Uefa had fallen outside a five-year “time bar” which prevented historical charges. But the tribunal also argued that one key charge over payments relating to sponsorship by Etihad Airlines was “not established”. The panel said Uefa had submitted insufficient evidence and that, if its case had been correct, then City employees who had given testimony to Cas would have had to have been lying.\n\nIs this the result of ‘Football Leaks’?\n\nUefa found City in breach of its financial fair play regulations in 2014 but reached a settlement under which City paid a €20m (£17m) fine and submitted reduced squads to the Champions League. The revisiting of alleged irregularities came after the document hack known as “Football Leaks” in 2015 exposed what appear to be official documents and email communication from inside City, alongside a number of other football organisations. These documents are understood to also have prompted the Premier League’s investigation, a four-year process which has brought these charges. City have previously described Football Leaks as an “orchestrated campaign” and part of “an endless attempt to damage us”.',

        'Can AI improve football teams’ success from corner kicks? Liverpool and others are betting it can',
    content:
        'Last Sunday, Liverpool faced Manchester United in the quarter finals of the FA Cup – and in the final minute of extra time, with the score tied at three-all, Liverpool had the crucial opportunity of a corner kick. A goal would surely mean victory, but losing possession could be risky.\n\nWhat was Liverpool to do? Attack or play it safe? And if they were to attack, how best to do it? What kind of delivery, and where should players be waiting to attack the ball?\n\nSet-piece decisions like this are vital not only in football but in many other competitive sports, and traditionally they are made by coaches on the basis of long experience and analysis. However, Liverpool has recently been looking to an unexpected source for advice: researchers at the Google-owned UK-based artificial intelligence (AI) lab DeepMind.\n\nIn a paper published today in Nature Communications, DeepMind researchers describe an AI system for football tactics called TacticAI, which can assist in developing successful corner kick routines. The paper says experts at Liverpool favoured TacticAI’s advice over existing tactics in 90% of cases.\n\nWhat TacticAI can do\n\nAt a corner kick, play stops and each team has the chance to organise its players on the field before the attacking team kicks the ball back into play – usually with a specific prearranged plan in mind that will (hopefully) let them score a goal. Advice on these prearranged plans or routines is what TacticAI sets out to offer.\n\nThe package has three components: one that predicts which player is most likely to receive the ball in a given scenario, another that predicts whether a shot on goal will be taken, and a third that recommends how to adjust the position of players to increase or decrease the chances of a shot on goal.\n\nTrained on a dataset of 7,176 corner kicks from Premier League matches, TacticAI used a technique called “geometric deep learning” to identify key strategic patterns.\n\nThe researchers say this approach could be applied not only to football, but to any sport in which a stoppage in the game allows teams to deliberately manoeuvre players into place unopposed, and plan the next sequence of play. In football, it could also be expanded in future to incorporate throw-in routines as well as other set pieces such as attacking free kicks.\n\nVast amounts of data\n\nAI in football is not new. Even in amateur and semi-professional football, AI-powered auto-tracking camera systems are becoming commonplace, for example. At the last men’s and women’s World Cups in 2022 and 2023, AI in conjunction with advanced ball-tracking technology produced semi-automated offside decisions with an unprecedented level of accuracy.\n\nProfessional football clubs have analytical departments using AI at every level of the game, predominantly in the areas of scouting, recruitment and athlete monitoring. Other research has also tried to predict players’ shots on goal, or guess from a video what off-screen players are doing.\n\nBringing AI into tactical decisions promises to offer coaches a more objective and analytical approach to the game. Algorithms can process vast amounts of data, identifying patterns that may not be apparent to the naked eye, giving teams valuable insights into their own performance as well as that of their opponents.\n\nA useful tool\n\nAI may be a useful tool, but it cannot make decisions about match play alone. An algorithm might suggest the optimal positional setup for an in-swinging corner or how best to exploit the opposition’s defensive tactics.\n\nWhat AI cannot do is make decisions on the fly – like deciding whether to take a corner quickly to exploit an opponent’s lapse in concentration.There’s also something to be said for allowing players creative licence in some situations. Once teams are using AI to suggest the optimal corner strategy, opponents will doubtless counter with their own AI-prompted defensive setup.\n\nSo while the tech behind TacticAI is very interesting, it remains to be seen whether it can evolve to be useful in open play. Could AI get to the stage where it can recognise the best tactical player substitution in a given situation?\n\nDeepMind researchers have advanced decision-making like this in their sights for future research, but will it ever reach a point where coaches would trust it?\n\nMy sense from discussions with people in the industry is many believe AI should only be used as an input to decision-making, and not be allowed to make decisions itself. There is no substitute for the experience and instinct of the best coaches, the intangible ability to feel what the game needs, to make a change in formation, to play someone out of position.',

        'Pelé was ensnared by ‘Brazilian-style racism’ but stood firm as dictatorship tried to keep him playing',
    content:
        'Following the death of arguably the greatest soccer player of all time, Prof José Paulo Florenzano of the Pontifical Catholic University of São Paulo considers Pelé’s incredible legacy off the field. This article was originally written in Portuguese.\n\nPelé occupies a central, albeit problematic, place in the construction and affirmation of Brazil’s national identity. His role in helping forge the identity of modern Brazil has roots in helping the country win the World Cup in Sweden in 1958 and in the global role taken on soon after by his club team, Santos.\n\nSantos in the Pelé era travelled the planet as sporting diplomats, crossing ideological divides between communism and capitalism and celebrating the political emancipation of nations emerging from colonialism.\n\nThere is no doubt that the main achievements of the teams led by Pelé were encouraging the playing of soccer in countries where the sport was rarely played, and, conversely, to have transformed the way the game was played in traditional soccer nations. In doing so, Pelé transcended the role of “national idol.” He became something much more significant: a symbol of the Black diaspora, a pan-African reference point and a cosmopolitan icon.\n\nIt was no coincidence that Bob Marley – who similarly was held up as a hero to the Global South – made a point of wearing Pelé’s number 10 shirt during the singer’s brief visit to Brazil in 1980. To Marley and others, Pelé embodied the aesthetic of soccer as art and an expression of freedom.\n\nOutside Brazil, nowhere was Pele’s presence as an icon of Black achievement felt more than in a decolonising Africa.\n\nThe Mozambican footballing great Eusébio – who represented colonial masters Portugal on the international stage – first found his soccer identity playing for “Os Brasileiros” (The Brazilians), a team created in the suburbs of what is now the capital Maputo, in homage to 1958 World Cup winners.\n\nIndeed, countless African players from the capital of Mozambique were given the nicknames of “Pelé”, “Garrincha”, or “Didi” – three Black heroes of the Brazilian national team, and an inspiration for millions across the African continent.',
